# Text-Editor-with-doodling-feature
A text editor is a program that allows the user to open, view, and edit plain text files (files containing only text). They are essential to the world today.Text editors deal with manipulating text and provide features to enhance the writing experience. The major functionalities of text editors are: inserting, deleting, and viewing text. Additional features are: find and replace, copy/cut and paste, text formatting, sentence highlighting, and etc.With their relevance in every programming, sub-culture Text Editors tops the list since text-editor is the basic tool everyone uses.The bare backbones of a text editor heavily relies on the data structures. Data Structures are used to add major functionalities and features in a text editor. So we have decided to create a unique Text Editor D-Pad, by using various data structures like Gap buffer , Binary trees etc and java programming where users will be able to express their emotions while writing and add spice to their text by using a doodles enhancing the overall text and writing experience. 

Dpad is a Text Editor which will include File operations, Data structures and will be created in Java.

Dpad will consist of File Handling operations to save , edit, print and delete text documents.
Text editing in Dpad will be achieved by using  data structures in functions like cut, copy, paste, undo and redo.
Dpad  will have functions to change the Format of the text considering user preferences providing various  Font-families, font-style, font-color and font-size  accomplished by diverse inbuilt java libraries . 

For user convenience and elevated options Dpad will include variety of view options allowing the user to set themes to the executable application, vary the size of the text in their document and for additional ease have a spell check functionality..  

The methodology is that Dpad will be divided into 4 parts then executed individually, compiled and transformed into a functional website.

#REAL-TIME USAGE OF PROJECT:
Text Editor is not only related to programming but it is a software through which you can write or edit some text. As far as programming is concerned you have to write or code your programme in a text editor and then you have to compile your code using a compiler.

1) It can be used to pen down thoughts.

2)We can take notes in class for a lot of subjects when teachers are teaching in pace and we have to keep up or take the summary / important points.

3)Using doodle will enhance our writing experience and will make the notes more attractive and understandable.


This project will largely be used by students because now-a-days,
everyone is attending online classes and meetings and there are times when we cannot write all the points or some symbols such as pi, epsilon, infinity,etc. are not even present on the keyboards.Therefore in such scenarios our project could be a huge breakthrough. We are adding more and more symbols in our dataset for the user’s convenience.

Dpad is a text editor where you get doodling and drawing features along with all the basic features of a text editor such as saving and opening a file,undo,redo, spellcheck and formatting options. We have made the text editor in java using “eclipse”as IDE and concepts of “Data structure and Algorithms” such as “Hash table” and “Gap Buffer” are implemented. Our canvas is created using JFrame.It has various options such as brush size,color palette,undo,redo, etc. Our dataset consists of 40 image set which consists of 4-5 options each.
